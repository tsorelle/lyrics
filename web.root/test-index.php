            Singing row away, row o'er the waters so blue<br>
Like a feather we'll float in my Gum Tree Canoe
        </p>
        <p>
On the Tombigbee river so bright I was born; In a hut made of husks of the tall yellow corn<br>
It was there I first met with my Julia so true; And I rowed her about in my Gum Tree Canoe
        </p><p>
All day in the fields of soft cotton I'd hoe; I think of my Julia and sing as I go<br>
Oh, I catch her a bird with a wing of true blue; And at night sail her â€˜round in my Gum Tree Canoe
        </p><p>
With my hands on the banjo and toe on the oar; I sing to the sound of the river's soft roar<br>
While the stars they look down on my Julia so true; And dance in her eyes in my Gum Tree Canoe
        </p><p>
One night the stream bore us so far away;  That we couldn't come back, so we thought we'd just stay<br>
Oh, we spied a tall ship with a flag of true blue; And it took us in tow in our Gum Tree Canoe
        </p>
