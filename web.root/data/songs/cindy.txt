Key – C

You ought to see my Cindy,  She’s from way down south.
 She's so sweet the honey bees,  Swarm all 'round her mouth.

She told me that she loved me,  She called me sugar plum,
 She throwed her arms around my neck  I thought my time had come

She took me to the parlor She cooled me with her fan
 She said I was the prettiest thing  In the shape of mortal man

Now Cindy got religion, She wheeled round and round
 She got so full of glory  That she knocked the preacher down

Cindy went to meetin',  She shouted and she squeeled;
 She got so much religion  She broke her stocking heel.

Cindy's got religion,  She had it once before,
 But when she hears my old banjo  She's the first one on the floor!

Apples in the summer time, peaches in the fall,
 If I can't have that Cindy gal I won't have none at all.

If I had my Cindy gal  I'd put her on a shelf;
 Every time she smiled at me,  I'd jump up there myself.
