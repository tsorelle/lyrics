Key  E (c/4)

Every morning just at five,  Gotta get up, dead or alive
 It's hard times in the mill my love  Hard times in the mill

Every mornin' right at six  Don't that ol' bell make you sick

The pulley got hot, the belt jumped off  Knocked Mr Guyan's derby off

Section hand he thinks he's a man  He ain't got sense to pay off his hands

My bobbin's all out, my end's all down  The doffer's in my alley an' I can't get around

The section hand, standin' at the door  Ordering the sweepers to sweep up the floor

An' every night when I go home   A piece o' cornbread an' an ol' jawbone

Ain't it enough to break your heart  Have to work all day, an' at night it's dark
