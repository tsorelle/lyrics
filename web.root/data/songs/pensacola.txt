Pensacola  (aFACF)
I'm going to join the army,  I'm going to volunteer
 I'm going to be a soldier,  Before another year.

I'm going to Pensacola,  To tarry awhile;
 Far from you, my darling, More than a hundred miles.

O hear the cannon roaring,  See the bullets fly
 Hear the drum a-beating,  To drown the soldier's cry.

O stay at home, dear Johnny,  Make me your wife		(break)
 If you go to Pensacola,  They'll surely take your life.

They'll put you in the center,  There you'll be slain
 It'll burst my heart asunder  To never see you again.

Let me go with you, Johnny, I'll travel at your side
 When the war is over Then I will be your bride.

No stay at home, dear Nancy,  Lead a single life		(break)
 If I do come back again,  I'll make you my wife.

They marched him through the country,  Marched him into town
 He marched to Pensacola,  And there they shot him down.

I'm weary of the fighting,  Weary of the war
 Farewell, my Johnny,  I'll never see you no more.
