Way back yonder in Tennesee, they leased the convicts out
They worked ‘em in the coal mines, against free labor South;
Free labor rebelled against it. To win it took some time.
But while the lease was in effect, they made 'em rise and shine.

Buddy, won't you roll down the line?

Early Monday morning they’ve got em out on time,
March them down to Lone Rock, just to look into that mine.
March you down to Lone Rock, just to look into that hole
Very last words the captain says "You better get your coal."

Buddy, won’t you ...

The beans they are half done, the bread is not so well.
The meat it is burnt up and the coffee's black as heck.
But when you get your task done you’re glad to come to call
For anything you get to eat it tastes good, done or raw.

Buddy, won’t you ...

The bank boss he's a hard man, a man you all know well,
And if you don't get your task done, he's gonna give you hallelujah!
Carry you to the stockade, and it's on the floor you fall
The very next time the call on you, you bet you’ll have your coal.
