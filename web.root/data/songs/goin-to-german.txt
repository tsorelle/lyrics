Key â€“ G

I'm goin' to German; I'll be back some ol' day.

Please tell me, mama: what more can I do?
Done all I knowed; I can't get along with you.

Get 'way f'm my window; stop knockin' on my, stop knockin' on my door.
I got no woman; can't use you no more.

When you's in trouble; I worked an' paid yo', I worked an' paid yo' fine.
Now I'm just trouble; you don't pay me no mind.
