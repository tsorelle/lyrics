Wash up your face, boys, comb up your head; Now get ready for your coffee and bread.

If s a piece of cold meat and cold corn bread; It's so cold it's heavy as lead

We're in jail and it's so complete; About one-half enough to eat,

It almost makes my stomache ache; When they bring the potatoes on the old tin plate,

We're in jail and it is so nice; Among the dirt and body lice,

The Wise county jail's no jail at all; The chinches and bugs are walking the wall
