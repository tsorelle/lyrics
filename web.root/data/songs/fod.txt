As I went down to the mowin' field, A big black snake got me by the heel

I fell down upon the ground, I shut both eyes and looked all around

Set upon a stump to take my rest, It looked like a woodchuck on his nest

The woodchuck grinned a banjo song, Up come skunk with his britches on

The woodchuck and skunk got into a fight, Smelled so bad that it put out the light

They danced and they played till the chimbley 'gin to rust
Hard to tell which smelled the worst
