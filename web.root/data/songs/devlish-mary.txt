Devilish Mary – G

When I was young and in my prime,  I thought I never would marry;
 Fell in love with a pretty little girl  And sure ‘nuff we got married

Rink come a dink dum a derry,
 Prettiest little girl I ever did see
 And her name was Devilish Mary

We both was young and foolish,  Got in the devil of a hurry;
 We both agreed upon one word,  And the wedding day was Thursday.

We hadn't been married but about three weeks,  Till she got as mean as the devil,
 An' ever' time I looked cross-eyed,  She knocked me in the head with the shovel.

She washed my clothes in old soap suds,  She wouldn’t do no dishes
 She let me know right from the start,  That she’s gonna where the britches.

We hadn't been married but about six month,  When she said we better be parted;
 She gathered up her duds and things.  And down the road she started .

If ever I marry an another wife,  Won't be for love nor riches;
 I'll marry a little that's two foot high,  So she cain't wear my britches!
