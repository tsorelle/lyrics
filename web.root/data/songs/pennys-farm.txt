Penny’s Farm – C
Come you ladies and you gentlemen and listen to my song
 I'll sing it to you right but you might think it's wrong
 Make may you mad, but I mean no harm

Now you move out on Penny's farm
 Plant a little crop of 'bacco and a little crop of corn
 He'll come around to plan and plot
 Till he gets himself a mortgage on everything you got

Don’t George Penny have a flatterin' mouth,
 He moves you to the country in a little log house.
 You got no windows but the cracks in the wall.
 He works you all the summer, then robs you in the fall.

You got to the fields and you work all day
 Till way after dark but you get no pay
 Promise you meat or a little lard
 It's hard to be a renter on Penny's farm

Now here's George Penny come into town
 With a wagon-load of peaches, not one of them sound
 He's got to have his money or somebody's check
 You pay him for a bushel and you don't get a pack

Then George penny renters they come into town
 With their hands in their pockets and their heads hanging down
 Go in the store and the merchant will say:
 Your mortgage is due and I'm looking for my pay

Goes down in his pocket with a trembling hand:
 Can't pay you all but I'll pay you what I can
 Then to the telephone the merchant makes a call:
 They'll put you on the chain gang if you don't pay it all!
