Now, I know a little ditty, it's as crazy as can be
 The guy who wrote it said he wanted it, and handed it to me
 I found I couldn't use it, because it sounded blue
 And that's the very reason why I'm handing it to you

It's a song the alligators sing, while coming through the rye
 As they serenade the elephants, up in the trees so high
 The iceman hums this ditty, as he shovels in the coal
 And the monkeys join the chorus, up around the northern pole

Ain't we crazy, ain't we crazy . . .

It was midnight on the ocean, not a streetcar was in sight
 And the sun was shining brightly, for it rained all day that night
 'Twas a summer night in winter, and the rain was snowing fast
 And a barefoot boy with shoes on stood a-sitting in the grass

It was evening, and the rising sun was setting in the west
 The little fishes in the trees were huddled in their nests
 The rain was pouring down and the moon was shining bright
 And everything that you could see was hidden out of sight

While the organ peeled potatoes, lard was rendered by the choir
 The sexton rung the dishrag, someone set the church on fire
 "Holy smoke!" The preacher shouted, in the rain he lost his hair
 Now his head resembles heaven, for there is no parting there

The cows were making cowslips, and the bells were ringing wet
 And the bumblebees were making bums, and smoking cigarettes
 And a man slept in a stable, and came out a little hoarse
 So he hopped upon his golf sticks, and drove all around the course

Ain't we crazy, ain't we crazy . . .

It was midnight on the ocean, not a horsecar was in sight
 As I stepped into the drugstore, to get myself a light
 The man behind the counter, was a woman old and gray
 Who used to peddle shoestrings, on the road to Mandalay.

"Good evening, sir," the woman said, and her eyes were bright with tears
 As she put her head beneath her feet, and stood that way for years
 Her children, six, were orphans, except one tiny tot
 Who lived in a house across the street above a vacant lot
