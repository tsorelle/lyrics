(open c)

I'm going to the station, Going to catch the fastest train that goes;
I'm a-going back South, Where the weather suits my clothes.

I'm going back South, If I wear out 99 pair of shoes;
'Cause I'm broken hearted, I've got those down South blues.

I was reared in the country, Where the snow it never fell;
I'm a-going back South, If I don't do so well.

Oh my mama. told me, And my daddy told me too,
Don't you go off, honey, Let those men make a fool out of you.
