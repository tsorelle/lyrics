Wish I was in Bowling Green sittin' in a chair,
One arm round my pretty little miss, 'Tother 'round my dear

If you see that man of mine, tell him once for me
If he loves another girl, Yes I'II set him free

Wish I was a bumblebee sailing through the air
Sail right down to my true love's side, Touch him if you dare.

Goin' through this whole wide world, I'm goin' through alone;
Goin' through this whole wide world, I ain't got no home,
